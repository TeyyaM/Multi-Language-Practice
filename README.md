# Personal Practice In Various Languages

The goal of this repository is as a series of folders, all unrelated, in which I practice writing code which serves identical functions. The difference being the language it is written in. The folders very in complexity. Currently, the languages in use are Javascript, Ruby, Python and Typescript.

Most code was originally written in Javascript, as it was my first coding language, and I am now going over and rewriting it.
